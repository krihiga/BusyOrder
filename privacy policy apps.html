  <h1>Busy Order Privacy Policy (Google Play Apps)</h1>
  <hr>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>Busy Order ("we," "us," or "our") creates mobile applications that help users be more productive, stay organized, and get more done. This Privacy Policy explains what information our Android apps collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. Please read this carefully before using our apps.</p>
  <p>We are committed to handling your data responsibly and transparently. Some of our apps function entirely on-device (data stays on your phone), while others connect to online services such as Firebase, Google Play Services, or advertising networks. The specific data collected may vary by app; see the App-Specific Details section below.</p>

  <h2>2. Apps Covered by This Policy</h2>
  <p>This policy applies to all current and future apps published under the Busy Order developer account on Google Play, including but not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Daily ToDo Planner – Personal task and productivity organizer with reminders.</li>
    <li>Any additional Busy Order apps released in the future.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If an app has its own in-app privacy notice, that notice will supplement (or, if clearly stated, override) this general policy.</p>

  <h2>7. Advertising & Analytics</h2>
  <p>Some Busy Order apps may display ads or collect analytics. These services may collect device identifiers, usage data, and approximate location for ad delivery or measurement.</p>
  <p><strong>AdMob:</strong> We partner with Google AdMob to show ads. AdMob may use device identifiers and ad performance data to deliver and improve ads. You can manage personalized ad settings in your Google account ad settings or via Android device ad personalization controls.</p>
  <p><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics and/or Crashlytics to understand app usage and improve stability. These services collect aggregated, non-personally identifying usage and crash data.</p>

  <h2>8. In-App Purchases & Subscriptions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not receive your full payment details (Google handles billing securely).</li>
    <li>We may receive a transaction ID and purchase status to unlock features.</li>
    <li>Subscription status (active/expired) may be synced to your account if sign-in is supported.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
  <p>Data storage depends on the app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>On-Device Only Data:</strong> Stays only on your device unless you export or back it up.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud-Synced Data:</strong> Stored in Firebase if you sign in or enable sync.</li>
    <li><strong>Audio Files:</strong> Typically remain on-device unless manually backed up.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We retain data as long as needed to provide the service. Cloud data may be deleted by request.</p>

  <h2>10. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Access, correct, or delete your data.</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent for optional processing.</li>
    <li>Opt out of personalized ads in device or Google ad settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>11. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard security such as HTTPS and access controls. However, no system is 100% secure. Please protect your device and keep apps updated.</p>

  <h2>12. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our apps are not for children under 13 unless explicitly designed for that audience. We do not knowingly collect data from children without parental consent.</p>

  <h2>Quick Copy – Minimal Privacy Summary</h2>
  <p>We do not collect personal information unless you choose to sign in or contact us. All data you enter (tasks, events, or recordings) stays on your device unless you enable cloud sync or backup. Some apps may use third-party services (Firebase, Google Play Services, AdMob) that collect limited technical data to provide app functionality, analytics, or ads. You can revoke permissions in device settings. For data deletion or questions, email busyorderofficial@gmail.com</p>
